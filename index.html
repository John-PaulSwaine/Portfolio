                        <p>For the navbar assignment, I had to resize a pre-set navbar to fit various screen sizes. I was unable to complete the stretch activities of making it resize depending on the size of the screen but I did attempt to do this.</p>

                        <p>For the Webclone Assignment I had to clone a pre-existing website as best as I could with the knowledge I have. The website I chose to clone was google.com. I chose this site as it doesn't have a lot of different things going on at once and so I felt that was ideal for me so I could also practice and develop some flexbox skills.</p>
