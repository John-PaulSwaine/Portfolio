                        <p>I took time to begin the development of a quiz planned, developed and created by myself. This quiz is using javascript, html, and css and I shall be altering my quiz using REACT upon learning about REACT more. The quiz is future-prof meaning I can add to my quiz as and when I desire.</p>

                        <p>For the Webclone Assignment I had to clone a pre-existing website as best as I could with the knowledge I have. The website I chose to clone was google.com. I chose this site as it doesn't have a lot of different things going on at once and so I felt that was ideal for me so I could also practice and develop some flexbox skills.</p>

                        <p>For the keycode assignment, I kept it simple both code-wise and aesthetically. This was done so as not to affect people who may suffer with photo-sensitive epilepsy by having different colours flashing for different keys.</p>

                        <p>For this assignment I had to create a dice game with a 1-player and 2-player game modes. I found this enjoyable as it enabled me to learn how to hide images until a certain outcome.</p>

                        <p>This week we had to work as part of a group in order to create a cyber pet game in which the pet has stat bars that continually decrease until death of the pet. It also had to include multiple buttons (e.g. eat, drink, sleep) to increase and decrease stat bars depending on which button was pressed (e.g. if the eat button was pressed the fed/hunger bar would increase while the thirst bar decreased). For this assignment I mainly focused on the classes for each of the pet options, provided assistance where needed to other team mates as well as bringing the page all together with the work of each team mate. I felt it was important to bring everything together to aid in the readability and to ensure functionality.</p>
