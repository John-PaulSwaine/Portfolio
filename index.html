                        <h3>Self Developed Quiz</h3>
                        <p>I took time to begin the development of a quiz planned, developed and created by myself. This quiz is using javascript, html, and css and I shall be altering my quiz using REACT upon learning about REACT more. The quiz is future-prof meaning I can add to my quiz as and when I desire.</p>

                        <p>For the navbar assignment, I had to resize a pre-set navbar to fit various screen sizes. I was unable to complete the stretch activities of making it resize depending on the size of the screen but I did attempt to do this.</p>

                        <p>For the Webclone Assignment I had to clone a pre-existing website as best as I could with the knowledge I have. The website I chose to clone was google.com. I chose this site as it doesn't have a lot of different things going on at once and so I felt that was ideal for me so I could also practice and develop some flexbox skills.</p>

                        <p>For the keycode assignment, I kept it simple both code-wise and aesthetically. This was done so as not to affect people who may suffer with photo-sensitive epilepsy by having different colours flashing for different keys.</p>

                        <p>For this assignment I had to create a dice game with a 1-player and 2-player game modes. I found this enjoyable as it enabled me to learn how to hide images until a certain outcome.</p>

                        <p>For this I had to create agame that selected random boxes and the player had to repeat in sequence with each level growing increasingly difficult. For this I also got assistance in implementing a 3-life rule where to lose you had to lose all 3 lives.</p>

                        <p>For this I had to generate a game where the computer generates a number between 1-100 and the user has to guess. It also had to advise higher or lower and count the amount of guesses made. </p>
